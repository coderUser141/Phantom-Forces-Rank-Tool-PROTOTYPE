	Read up on https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/uxguide/guidelines and find out how to make the GUI look better. It looks like an
old Windows application and that needs to be changed.

	Add better GUI by just using some program like Qt or Scintilla or something. Something that allows the UI to look splendid.

	Add cred summation
	for loop that invokes rank - > cred function to get creds per rank

"var a = [];
for(var i = 0; i < 35; i++){
    a.push(5*i);
}
30

var b = 0;
for(var j = 0; j < 35; j++){
    b+=(a[j] + 200);
}"
